SITUATION:<br/>Today we start our offensive operations against the enemy in southern Sahrani. Our special operations forces will try to neutralize some anti aircraft sites so we can move in more airmobile troops with helicopters. Also we start to strike enemy positions with precision strikes by jet aircraft when the enemy anti air network has been disabled.<br/><br/>2. MISSION:<br/>Two enemy anti aircraft artillery sites have been spotted. We must neutralize them to open a window for our aircrafts to operate in the area. You are now effectively weapons free after making contact with the first objective. Avoid contact before reaching there to maintain the surprise element.<br/><br/>3. EXECUTION:<br/>1-1-A team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from forest. Destroy <marker name = 'target1'>AA site 1</marker> and <marker name = 'target2'>AA site 2</marker> objectives. Try to avoid enemy troops and hold your fire until you have reached the first objective. Then you are cleared to shoot any enemies that might slow you down, but do try to avoid unecessary contact as your objectives are where your focus should be.<br/><br/>4. SERVICE AND SUPPORT<br/>You have no support on this mission, you'll have to manage on your own.<br/><br/>5. COMMAND AND SIGNAL<br/>Your callsign is 1-1-A."]];
