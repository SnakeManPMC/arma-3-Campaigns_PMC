<b>1. SITUATION:</b><br>
Operations on southern Sahrani start today with reconnaissance by special operations forces. In few days we should have a good picture of enemy force levels on the southern Sahrani.
<br><br>
<b>2. MISSION:</b><br>
You as SF operator are tasked to infiltrate to the enemy territory and conduct reconnaissance operations over several days. Your team is your only backup, the weapons you carry (and scavenge from the enemy) are the only gear you got. Choose your weapons and gear wisely. This is weapons on hold operation util ordered otherwise. Do not play a hero, do not fire upon the OPFOR unless you're cornered and there is absolutely no other choice. Avoid enemy contact at any cost. Maintain covert posture during the missions. Be prepared for demolitions for either using AT weapons or satchel charges. Your weapons must last at least four missions.
<br><br>
<b>3. EXECUTION:</b><br>
1-1-A team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from airstrip. Board <a href="marker:boardshp1">ship</a>, sail to Sahrani coastline and <a href="marker:lz1">disembark</a> to shore.
