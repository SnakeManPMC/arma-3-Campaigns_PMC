Your team is your only backup, the weapons you carry (and scavenge from the enemy) are the only gear you got. Choose your weapons and gear wisely. This is weapons on hold operation until ordered otherwise. Do not play a hero, do not fire upon the OPFOR unless you're cornered and there is absolutely no other choice. Avoid enemy contact at any cost. Maintain covert posture during the missions. Be prepared for demolitions for either using AT weapons or satchel charges.
