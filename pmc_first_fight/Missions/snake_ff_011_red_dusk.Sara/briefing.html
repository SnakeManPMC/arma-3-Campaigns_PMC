How they heck they found about us, meaning after we escaped is beyond me. Someone must have spotted us heading this way, I did see two squads coming after us who certainly alerted many many more. This is going to be tough ride baby...

<b>1. SITUATION:</b><br>
SLA forces are on high alert now after we took down their anti air sites, it made a real dent on their AA coverage on the southern Sahrani.
<br><br>
<b>2. MISSION:</b><br>
Your team was spotted (no idea by who and how), there is now enemy forces trailing you and they are angry as you knocked out their anti air sites. They want revenge. They're after you.
<br><br>
<b>3. EXECUTION:</b><br>
1-1-A team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from forest. Exfiltrate to the <a href="marker:extract">extract</a> location where UH60 will come to pick your team up. Do not get caught in firefights as your only goal is to get out alive, there is enough enemy forces after you to kill you ten times, act smart, live to fight another day. When onboard the blackhawk, fly back to the <a href="marker:basehq">base</a> safely to accomplish your long mission series.
<br><br>
<b>4. SERVICE AND SUPPORT</b><br>
UH60 Blackhawk is the extraction force, no other support available.
