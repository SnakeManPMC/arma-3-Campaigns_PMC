<b>1. SITUATION:</b><br>
Intelligence suggests that the southern Sahrani people are ready to fight against the enemy. We are currently in process of finding out the leadership, if any, out there. In the mean time our reconnaissance operations continue, we have good intel and hopefully in 24hrs can start to conduct offensive operations.
<br><br>
<b>2. MISSION:</b><br>
Make contact with the local people, act friendly (weapons safe), find out if they are willing to rise up to arms and defend their land. Avoid contact to the enemy forces, no shooting.
<br><br>
<b>3. EXECUTION:</b><br>
1-1-A team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from forest. Find <a href="marker:target1">civilians</a> from woods and initiate discussion with them. We need to find out if they are interested of helping us fighting the enemy. Weapons tight, no shooting and avoid enemy contact at all costs.
