Airbase. Damn, why do I think its going to be major pain in the ass to capture this place? And when we finally get it, what about holding it, damned look at the landscape, freaking big city just around the hill over there. One sniper on that hill and it can knock down our support personnel and such. Man this is going to be fun...

<b>1. SITUATION:</b><br>
One of the most imporant goals in this campaign is to capture the South Sahrani airbase from the SLA forces. From this base we can launch our air operations with ease unlike from the small Rahmadi island. We can bring a bear the mighty A-10 Warhog tank killers close air support aircraft and other jets to pound the enemy. When the airbase is set, no enemy armor is safe and our ground forces can move that much quicker. SLA knows this very well.
<br><br>
<b>2. MISSION:</b><br>
Capture the airbase.
<br><br>
<b>3. EXECUTION:</b><br>
