WAR SITUATION:<br/>Enemy is trying to take over the objectives in our region, you must prevent that and capture the objectives.<br/><br/>2. YOUR MISSION:<br/>Assault the objectives marked in the map with grey or red circle. Green circles are controlled by your forces. When you make the enemy retreat or seize their operations you'll get notification from HQ. If you get over 5000 enemy KIA's your mission is accomplished.<br/><br/>3. EXECUTION/INTEL:<br/>Enemy has brought in the full arsenal, infantry, soft vehicles, tanks and helicopters. Be careful with the friendly helicopters because there was Shilkas and SA-11's spotted earlier. Make sure you knock out the enemy artillery before using M252s or M101s, enemy counter battery fire is deadly. Make sure your base HQ is protected, while we do not believe enemy will target it specificly, they surely will end up there causing havoc at some point.<br/><br/>4. SUPPORT and ORBAT:<br/>Artillery; M252 mortars, M101 howitzers and M109 Paladin's are located at the US airbase. Attack sub with Tomahawk Cruise missiles is standing by. From radio you can call Ammo Drop, UH60 will bring ammoboxes for you in the field, please do not request ammodrop on hot LZ. A-10 airtstrikes with dumb bombs is available from radio. You can move the M109's with the IF menu. Move M252's and M101's from the Special menu but be careful where you transfer them.<br/><br/>5. SIGNALS and TACTICS:<br/>"]];
