Be careful with the friendly helicopters because there was Shilkas and SA-11's spotted earlier. Make sure you knock out the enemy artillery before using M252s or M101s, enemy counter battery fire is deadly. Make sure your base HQ is protected, while we do not believe enemy will target it specificly, they surely will end up there causing havoc at some point."]];
