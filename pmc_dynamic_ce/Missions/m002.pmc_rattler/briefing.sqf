EXECUTION/INTEL:<br/>Enemy has brought in the full arsenal, infantry, soft vehicles, tanks and helicopters. Be careful with the friendly helicopters because there was Shilkas and SA-11's spotted earlier. The artillery has been deadly during the past few hours. Make sure you knock out the enemy artillery before using M252s or M101s, enemy counter battery fire is deadly. Make sure your base HQ is protected, while we do not believe enemy will target it specificly, they surely will end up there causing havoc at some point.<br/><br/>4.

From radio you can call Ammo Drop, UH60 will bring ammoboxes for you in the field, please do not request ammodrop on hot LZ. A-10 airtstrikes with dumb bombs is available from radio. You can move the M109's with the IF menu. Move M252's and M101's from the Special menu but be careful where you transfer them.<br/><br/>5. SIGNALS and TACTICS:<br/>"]];
