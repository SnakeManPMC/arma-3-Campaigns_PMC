# arma-3-Campaigns_PMC

ArmA 3 all PMC campaigns, these campaign missions use CUP.

2018-02-04 note: porting from ofp-arma2 era is still work in progress and most of these do not work yet, they do load in eden editor without errors but playing these is another matter.

See [CUP download](http://cup-arma3.org/download) and [PMC Tactical ArmA 3](https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/index.php)

Campaigns:
* PMC Brave Hammer
* PMC Dynamic CE
* PMC Guerrilla Bastard
* PMC Heros Path
* PMC Joint Justice
* PMC Powder Bat
* PMC Real War 1
* PMC Tank Hunter
* 4 various test campaigns

I don't like having several campaigns / missions in one big blob repo, but its also crazy to have 100's of single mission dirs in github root.
