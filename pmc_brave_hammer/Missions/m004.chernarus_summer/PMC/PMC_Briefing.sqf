Basic guide how to keep it alive; fly 2000m altitude as 500m will get the drone shot down if T72/BMP weapons reach it.With 2000m altitude you then need to increase your viewDistance, do this temporarily from video options, object viewDistance should be at least 3-4km so you can properly spot enemy vehicles."]];
