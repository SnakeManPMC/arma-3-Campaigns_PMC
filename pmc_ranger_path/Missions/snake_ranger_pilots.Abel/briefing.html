<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Weather has cleared up but new stormy clouds appeared over the US base. We have apparently lost
one of our attack helicopter gunships behind enemy lines this afternoon. We will not leave 
no man behind, we are currently launching a rescue operation to get our people home.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
Mayday was heard from Charlie Black some time ago in southern Malden, they did not indicate
what was the problem but they were going down. No more radio comms have heard since but we 
do believe that they are still alive our there. The approx position of the crash site is 
between La Riviere and Chapoi, unfortunately we do not have more specific location.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from US airbase, UH-60 Black Hawk 
helo <a href="marker:insert">insert LZ</a> is north of the suspected crash site area 
where <a href="marker:downed">Apache down</a> is located. Find the crew, destroy the Apache wreck 
so it wont fall into enemy hands and get back 
to <a href="marker:extract">Extract LZ</a> location, use radio (0-0-1) to call extraction.
Mission is accomplished when you have destroyed the Apache, rescued the crew and returned to 
base safely.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
Damn this is bad one, Apache went down and we WILL get the pilots safely home. Find them, place
satchel charges under the downed bird and blow it up. Get back to the extract site as soon as 
possible, keep the site secure until extract hawk arrives. Dont make too much noise out there,
just find the crew and get back ASAP. Dont try to kill whole Russian army while youre out there.
 Goodspeed...
