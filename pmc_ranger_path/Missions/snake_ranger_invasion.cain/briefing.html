<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
US Invasion to Kolgujev begins today, our goal will be to completely seize this war torn
island in the near future. Russian occupation will be thrown out of here with overwhelming
force.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
You're looking at some lightly armored vehicles and infantry. They are not expecting you so
you'll have the suprise.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> with fast rope insertion to the beach, capture 
the enemy <a href="marker:target1">base</a> and also <a href="marker:target2">gate</a> in 
east. Try to take the base as fast as possible as there will be most likely enemy 
reinforcements being sent. When you have captured the base, we will send infantry squad in 
Blackhawk to take control of the enemy base and set up US field base. When the inf squad 
has arrived, move and seize the gate. Your mission is accomplished when both objectives 
are secured.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
We have suprise element here, Russians should not expect us so they are not in defensive 
posture. Hit them hard, hit them fast. You should have no problems with this, you're the 
Ranger and Rangers lead the way!
