<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Nogova airbase is being held by Russians, for now. Our objective today is to capture
that airbase and keep it secure so we can send in airlift cargo, troops, vehicles and
that way starting the fighting in this island. By tomorrow we hopefully have setup working
base here in the west coast.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
Infantry mostly, enemy has no armor in the airbase area. They do not expect the attack
as they dont have heavy troop concentrations in the area.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from ammo 
depot, <a href="marker:bravo">Bravo</a> squad gets inserted in the south. You'll both assault 
the <a href="marker:target1">Airbase</a> and take it from the Russians. Make use of 
the <a href="marker:ammobox1">Ammobox</a> dropped for you. When you have captured the 
objective, we will send more troops by helicopter insertion to back you up. Its most certain 
that Russians launch counter attack which you must defeat. Your mission is accomplished when
you have taken the airbase and repelled possible counter attacks. Good luck.
