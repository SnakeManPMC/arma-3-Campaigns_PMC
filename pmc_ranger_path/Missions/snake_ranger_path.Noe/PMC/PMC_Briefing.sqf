These missiles were launched fromsomewhere in eastern Nogova but we dont have much more precise location than that. The nextthing we do is to hunt down the SCUD locations and destroy them. We are not able to deployPatriot units into this region by that time it would be useful.<br/><br/>INTEL<br/>We have pieces of information about Russian Major travelling into north from Velka Ves in the next 30 minutes if not sooner. Hes most likely travelling with Spez Natz security team. <br/><br/>ORDERS<br/>Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from base, helicopter will ferry you intothe large river where you fast rope down to the dirt <marker name = 'insert'>road</marker> between the river and mountains. Set up an ambushthere and interdict the hopefully incoming convoy where Russian Major is travelling. When youhave snatched him, the helo will pick your team up at the same location and returns you backto base. This man is vital for Russian operations in Nogova. Do not kill the Major as we want to find the SCUD locations from him.<br/><br/>TACTICAL<br/>Snatching the Russians. Dont let your team mates kill the Major, these guys are known with theiritchy trigger fingers.<br/><br/>"]];
