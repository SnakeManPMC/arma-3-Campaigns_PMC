<p>
<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
US operations in Everon continue at good space, we have captured important cities and
continue our push towards south. Russians are putting heavy resistance in all fronts.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
Local civilians tipped us off that they have seen US soldier being held in Russian city
at Le Moule. There is some armored patrols nearby but the city itself has just infantry
defenses.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from the airbase, Uh-60 Black Hawk 
will <a href="marker:insert">Insert LZ</a> your team in the field. Secure the area near 
Le Moule neutralizing all patrolling enemies. When you have secured the area, call Deltas Teams 
to clear <a href="marker:target1">target</a> where the POW is presumed to be located. While Deltas
assault the city, keep their backs secure. When they are done, they call you in to pickup the POW.
When you have him custody, call Black Hawk to <a href="marker:extract">Extract LZ</a> your team 
out of there. Remember, nobody gets left behind.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
Okay this is the real deal. You will keep the Delta boy's backs covered out there, then you get
the glory to pick the POW up from the city. Keep him safe, watch your fire. Good luck and remember,
Rangers lead the way, Hooyah!
