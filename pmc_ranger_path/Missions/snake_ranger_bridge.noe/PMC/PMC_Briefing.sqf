Contact has been made with the enemy in the north and east of the airbase. So far our progress have been good, soon we will be taking firstlarge city objective. Our Special Operations Forces will conduct daring assault to the keybridge dividing Nogova in two. When we can get our forces to protect that bridge it meanswe can move troops and vehicles around much easier and the civilian government which will takeover at some distant future will be happy.<br/><br/>INTEL<br/>In the bridge you're looking at heavy infantry defenses along with some armored vehiclespatrolling. No heavy tanks present in the area. We do not believe that the Russians have riggeddemolitions to the bridge but we are not sure.<br/><br/>ORDERS<br/>Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from airbase, helo will ferry your team to a fast rope <marker name = 'insert'>insert</marker> position between the forests. From there proceed intoSE direction to the <marker name = 'target1'>bridge</marker> and assault the Russian defenses present. capturing the bridge intact is vital in this operation since we do not want to destroytoo much of the Nogovian infanstructure. When you have cleared the bridge, we will send backupinfantry to take over there. Secure the bridge until they arrive and if no Russian counter attackis in sight, then call helo to the <marker name = 'extract'>extract LZ</marker> to pick your team up.Your mission is accomplished when we got the bridge and you have returned to base. Good luck.<br/><br/>TACTICAL<br/>Okay dont shoot the bridge or the civvies be restless... who cares about the bridge lets drop few MK-84's there and be done with it, but no... we must send our best guys into harms way. Yes,that means you, so be careful out there. Dont take too many risks, you're alone until thereinforcements arrive.<br/><br/>"]];
