<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Our combat operations have begun in Nogova. Contact has been made with the enemy in the north 
and east of the airbase. So far our progress have been good, soon we will be taking first
large city objective. Our Special Operations Forces will conduct daring assault to the key
bridge dividing Nogova in two. When we can get our forces to protect that bridge it means
we can move troops and vehicles around much easier and the civilian government which will take
over at some distant future will be happy.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
In the bridge you're looking at heavy infantry defenses along with some armored vehicles
patrolling. No heavy tanks present in the area. We do not believe that the Russians have rigged
demolitions to the bridge but we are not sure.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from airbase, helo will ferry your team to 
a fast 
rope <a href="marker:insert">insert</a> position between the forests. From there proceed into
SE direction to the <a href="marker:target1">bridge</a> and assault the Russian defenses 
present. capturing the bridge intact is vital in this operation since we do not want to destroy
too much of the Nogovian infanstructure. When you have cleared the bridge, we will send backup
infantry to take over there. Secure the bridge until they arrive and if no Russian counter attack
is in sight, then call helo to the <a href="marker:extract">extract LZ</a> to pick your team up.
Your mission is accomplished when we got the bridge and you have returned to base. Good luck.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
Okay dont shoot the bridge or the civvies be restless... who cares about the bridge lets drop 
few MK-84's there and be done with it, but no... we must send our best guys into harms way. Yes,
that means you, so be careful out there. Dont take too many risks, you're alone until the
reinforcements arrive.
