<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Our troops are deploying into the northern Malden, some enemy assaults have been repelled
in the airbase in past two nights. Enemy is massing some armored vehicles from the south.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
At the moment the fuel depot is readying for incomig enemy vehicles, there is no enemy armor
present but they are on their way. We have time for about one quick strike to take out the
depot until they arrive.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
La Pessagne fuel depot is the main staging area for enemy vehicles, Alpha 
team is tasked to destroy that site. You'll <a href="marker:start">start</a> from base. 
UH-60 Black Hawk <a href="marker:insert">Insert LZ</a> point will be on the fields NE of 
the <a href="marker:target1">fuel depot</a> that enemy uses for refuelling and rearming. When
you have destroyed the target, use radio (0-0-1) to 
call <a href="marker:extract">Extraction</a> with UH-60. Mission is accomplished when any 
vehicles and fuel equipment are destroyed there and you will arrive safely at home base.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
Make this one fast, the enemy armored vehicles will kick your behind if they get there while
you're still on the ground.
