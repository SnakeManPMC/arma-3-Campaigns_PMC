Enemy is well dug in at their positions. We also suspect the enemy Spez Natz base in on this part of the island.<br/><br/>ORDERS<br/>Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from south of the small woods. Your mission is toneutralize all enemies in and capture all four objectives. These include: <marker name = 'target1'>Target #1</marker> which is enemy base,<br/> <marker name = 'target2'>Target #2</marker> the city ruins, <marker name = 'target3'>Target #3</marker> another city ruins and finally<br/><marker name = 'target4'>Target #4</marker> which is the northern seaport of Kolgujev. Your supportis ammo drop and A-10 airstrikes available from radio. Your mission is accomplished when all these objectives are under your control.<br/><br/>TACTICAL<br/>You have lot of ground to cover and lot of enemies to deal with, conserve your ammunition andstay healthy out there. Use radio (0-0-1) to call ammo drop by Blackhawk helo, the helo will arriveto that location where you're at the present time. A-10 airstrike with dumb bombs is called fromradio (0-0-2) and then clicking on the (M) Map view. The A-10 is loitering west of your engagement area and he will drop 4 dumb bombs on the bombing run, you got one bombing run only. So align the target marker just bit W, NW of your intended target impact point to maximise the damage. Good luck.<br/><br/>"]];
