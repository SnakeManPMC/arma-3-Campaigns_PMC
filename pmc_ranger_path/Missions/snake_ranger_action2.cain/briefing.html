<h2><a name="MySection">PMC Ranger Action 2</a></h2>
<p>
<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
We are pushing out against Russian positions on NE part of Kolgujev, Rangers will
be our point forces and other troops follow them as objectives have been secured.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
You'll be expecting mix of regular infantry, bmps and some tanks. Enemy is well dug in 
at their positions. We also suspect the enemy Spez Natz base in on this part of the island.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from south of the small woods. Your mission is to
neutralize all enemies in and capture all four objectives. These include: 
<a href="marker:target1">Target #1</a> which is enemy base,<br> 
<a href="marker:target2">Target #2</a> the city ruins, 
<a href="marker:target3">Target #3</a> another city ruins and finally<br>
<a href="marker:target4">Target #4</a> which is the northern seaport of Kolgujev. Your support
is ammo drop and A-10 airstrikes available from radio. Your mission is accomplished when all 
these objectives are under your control.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
You have lot of ground to cover and lot of enemies to deal with, conserve your ammunition and
stay healthy out there. Use radio (0-0-1) to call ammo drop by Blackhawk helo, the helo will arrive
to that location where you're at the present time. A-10 airstrike with dumb bombs is called from
radio (0-0-2) and then clicking on the (M) Map view. The A-10 is loitering west of your 
engagement area and he will drop 4 dumb bombs on the bombing run, you got one bombing run only. 
So align the target marker just bit W, NW of your intended target impact point to maximise 
the damage. Good luck.
