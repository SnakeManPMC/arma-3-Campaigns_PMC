<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Our war effort on Everon proceeds according to the plan, with minimum of losses so far. We
are hopeful that in few days we reach into Montignac and capture that important city.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
We have very good intel that Russian Colonel handeling the operations in northern sector
is meeting with his people on either Figari or Provins.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from base, UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter
will <a href="marker:insert">insert LZ</a> you to a field just west of your targets. 
Proceed and search 
the <a href="marker:target1">Figari</a> and <a href="marker:target2">Provins</a> for enemy 
Colonel located there. Capture him alive, do not harm him fatally, and bring him 
to the pre selected <a href="marker:extract">Extract LZ</a> for transportation to US base
onboard the Black Hawk helicopter. Be careful, good luck.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
All right, this is tricky. The Colonel should be on the houses we assume, approach carefully
dont let your team mates take him out, try to wound him if he does not surrender immediately.
Do not kill him or all of this is worth nothing.
