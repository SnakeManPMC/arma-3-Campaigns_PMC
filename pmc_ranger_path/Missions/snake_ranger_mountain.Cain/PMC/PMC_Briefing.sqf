Theywill be place where enemy soldiers have been shooting SA-7 missiles to our helos, its utmostimportance that we capture them ASAP.<br/><br/>INTEL<br/>There are enemy AA emplacements as one of our helos was shot down yesterday south of target 2position. You should not expect heavy armor as the area is rather narrow for them. Infantry ismostly on defensive positions.<br/><br/>ORDERS<br/>Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from road west from the first base, assault and capture the <marker name = 'target1'>base #1</marker> and also the second <marker name = 'target2'>base #2</marker> bit more to the east along the road. Mission is accomplished when both bases are under US control.<br/><br/>TACTICAL<br/>Okay now we get some payback from the downed helo, the AA which got him came from one of (or both) these bases which you are tasked to kill. Be alert for north and south as the mountain range is verysteep, no armor or vehicles are to be expected from there but infantry assault is possible. So watchyour six.<br/><br/>"]];
