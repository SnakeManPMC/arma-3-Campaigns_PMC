See <a href="#MySection">War Situation</a> for details.<br><br>

Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from road, assault and capture
the <a href="marker:target1">base #1</a> and second <a href="marker:target2">base #2</a> bit
more to the east.
<br><br>
Good luck.

<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Our next objective is to capture the central island bases right up in the mountains. They
will be place where enemy soldiers have been shooting SA-7 missiles to our helos, its utmost
importance that we capture them ASAP.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
There are enemy AA emplacements as one of our helos was shot down yesterday south of target 2
position. You should not expect heavy armor as the area is rather narrow for them. Infantry is
mostly on defensive positions.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from road west from the first base, assault and 
capture the <a href="marker:target1">base #1</a> and also the 
second <a href="marker:target2">base #2</a> bit more to the east along the road. Mission is 
accomplished when both bases are under US control.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
Okay now we get some payback from the downed helo, the AA which got him came from one of (or both) 
these bases which you are tasked to kill. Be alert for north and south as the mountain range is very
steep, no armor or vehicles are to be expected from there but infantry assault is possible. So watch
your six.
