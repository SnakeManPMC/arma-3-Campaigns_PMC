<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Rangers are taking on the Russian positions in NW Kolgujev today, all other forces
should keep a distance until Rangers have cleared and secured the city.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
We estimate that there is two squads plus some additional infantry present in the target
city, also some vehicles have been spotted. Armor are mostly based further into east.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> just west from todays target objective. Your task
is to assault the objective city and <a href="marker:target1">capture</a> from the Russians.
Mission is accomplished when you have control over the city.
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
There are only few vehicles present so this would be mostly infantry fight today. Stay alert
for any reinforcements though, they would come from eastern direction. Rangers lead the way, 
Hooyah!
