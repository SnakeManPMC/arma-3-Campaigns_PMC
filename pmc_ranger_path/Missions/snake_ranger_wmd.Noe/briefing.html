<b>GEN SITREP</b><br>
Russians are kept sizable supply of weapons of mass destruction on ultra secret location in
Nogova. We have just learnt that they have brought out the WMD material and are preparing to
equip a SCUD missile warhead with them. If that missile is launched to the population or in
US headquarters/positions, we will be in serious trouble. Our best people are put in charge to
neutralize the WMD theat to Nogovian polulation and our forces. At the same time we are 
launching full scale attack on the eastern sector consisting the final goal of Lipany, if we are
successfull we can end this war in one quick swift move.
<br><br>

<b>INTEL</b><br>
Our best interrogators were working on the Russian Major for all night and they were successfull
extracting vital information. Russian field commanders have given orders to bring out the WMD 
material, load a SCUD missile with them and keep 15 minutes stand by alert if the US forces 
happen to launch assault on the remaining Russian positions. Better yet, we have the exact map 
grid coordinates of the WMD site.
<br><br>

<b>ORDERS</b><br>
Alpha team <a href="marker:start">start</a> from air onboard MH-47E Chinook helo, they 
will <a href="marker:insert">insert LZ</a> your squad into the beach on the east coast. From there
you must proceed using stealth to the <a href="marker:target1">WMD Site</a> and neutralize it 
using high explosive satchel charges. The main targets are the SCUD launcher and Fuel truck which
is converted to carry WMD agents. When the objective is met, you must travel on foot back to the 
friendly positions in <a href="marker:escape">Bridge</a> east end. Try to avoid contact if 
possible, dont take too many risks. 
<br><br>

<b>TACTICAL</b><br>
Oh lord, weapons of mass destruction... you gotta love those ruskies, goddamnit! Ok the intel
peeps say if you place satchel charges to destroy the SCUD and Fuel truck there should be no
chem/bio fallout to hazard the population or your team. Lets hope they are correct on this one.
And hey, do not freaking get yourself killed out there even when your objective is met, get your
team back alive into the bridge. You'll do no good to anyone if youre in some unnamed grave in 
Nogovian landscape. OK, off you go, cu soon and... Godspeed.
