<a href="marker:start">HQ</a> is at Rahmadi. Conduct daring raid on <a href="marker:target1">Benoma</a> objective to capture it. Do not wander into enemy territory otherwise.<br><br>
Use MH-6's to insert your troops, they are cleared to overfly the keepout areas, but your infantry or other vehicles are not to enter into this area.
